# Natural language processing
This repository contains practicals from the "Natural Language Processing" course, which covers deep learning methods in NLP.

**Practical 1: Word Vectors**
This practical introduces two embedding methods: word2vec and co-occurrence embeddings. It also adresses challenges associated with embeddings, such as polysemous words, synonyms/antonyms and bias.

**Practical 2: Word2vec Algorithm**
This practical offers a detailed, low-level implementation of the word2vec algorithm, complete with all the necessary gradient calculations. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

**Practical 3: Self-Attention and Transformers**
The third practical consists of two parts. The first part contains linear algebra exercises designed to build a foundational understanding of self-attention. The second part focuses on pretraining and finetuning a transformer model.

**Practical 4: Task-Oriented Dialogue System**
Practical 4 presents the implementation of a task-oriented dialogue system. This system assists users in finding restaurants in Cambridge, UK, based on criteria such as food type, price range, and location.
